### Bootstrapped with DCollage (Digital Collage Boilerplate w/ PIXIJS)

The goal of DCollage is to facilitate the creation of multi-layered, interactive, collages similar to those I created back in the days of Flash. Surprise it works for simple games too! [https://github.com/jrod-disco/dcollage-pixijs-boilerplate/wiki](See the wiki for additional information.)
